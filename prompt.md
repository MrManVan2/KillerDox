I've added the assets. Offering are organized by rarity (sub folders) review those and ensure they still work with the site

Addons have sub folders for killer specific addons. (Use the list of truth I sent you in the chat) (these are ones that are only availible to that killer.) When the killer is selected only addons availible to them show / can be selected. There are sub folders with the dead by daylight code name for the killer. maybe search the web to link these code names with the killers I have. Names of killers are in the killer icon file names.

Check the placeholder files. New correct files are the "blank" set I put in there. Needs to display on the site
